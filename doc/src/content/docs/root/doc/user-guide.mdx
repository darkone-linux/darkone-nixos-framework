## My sovereign and secure cloud

:::note[Read carefully]
This introduction is very useful for understanding the purpose and functioning of the cloud.
:::

- **A convenient and secure digital space** for my data.
- **Useful services**: messaging, video calls, documents, media, backups, games...
- **Pre-installed Linux systems** (optional) that are very easy to use.

:::tip[Ideal for young people]
A protected space suited for the youngest, for a controlled learning of IT and networks!
:::

### The benefits

* 🔐 **Maximum security**: our data remains controlled and passes through encrypted.
* 🚫 **No data leaks** to advertisers, AI, insurance, taxes...
* 🔁 **Automated 3-2-1 backups**, encrypted, distributed, compressed.
* 🕐 **Top applications**, stable, useful and simple, to save time.
* 🔑 **Only one password** to remember (SSO + vault).
* 👶 **User-friendly** for small and big.

:::note[My digital heritage]
Photos, videos, stories, contacts, dialogues, passwords... more and more memories and data linked to my heritage are now digital.
Using a safe, sovereign, and controlled place for this data, which forms my identity, is paramount. This is the purpose of this cloud.
:::

:::tip[Should I leave the GAFAM?]
No. These companies offer useful services. Thousands of engineers work there, making the simplicity and efficiency of their tools hard to match.
They also give a lot to the open-source world and are sometimes precious partners.
However, their private nature does not allow them to guarantee a total and safe space of freedom for all my personal data and conversations.
This data can be analyzed and potentially transmitted to advertisers, insurance, AI engines, government services.
Technically, my data can also be confiscated, diverted, and kept against my will, even if a serious professional would not do this.
So it's up to me to make the distinction.
:::

### The services

These reliable [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) applications are carefully selected for their usefulness, maturity, and ease of use.

:::tip[Single Sign-On (SSO)]
A single login is sufficient for each of them (no need to enter 36 passwords).

### Linux workstations (NixOS)

The cloud's Linux system can be installed on any PC computer connected to the network.

:::caution[Is Linux complicated?]
Contrary to what people think, **Linux and its applications have become very simple to use.**
And our pre-installed system is even easier to get started with!
:::

:::tip[A time saver at all levels]
* 100% pre-installed -> programs, user accounts and configurations, everything is there.
* 100% managed → no need to administer the system, everything is automatic.
* Ideal and performant with old PCs that we no longer use.
:::

:::note[Why Linux / NixOS?]
- **Linux** is a free system, therefore safe, in line with the idea of a sovereign and secure digital space. The transparency of Linux's code guarantees the absence of "backdoors" and potentially unwanted programs.
- **NixOS** is an innovative Linux system that allows for reproducibility, meticulous configurations, and great stability.
:::

### User profiles

Each user is linked to a "profile" (choice and interchangeable), which determines:

* The programs and configurations for [workstations](#linux-workstations-nixos) (education, office, games...).
* Access and configuration for [online services](#the-services).

| **Profile** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| ⚪ minimal | Strict minimum of programs and tools. |
| 🔵 normal | For non-technical office user -> the essentials. |
| 🟣 advanced | For developers -> a nice shell and development tools. |
| 🔴 admin | Account dedicated to network and system administrators (expert). |
| 🎨 creator | For multimedia creator -> video, music, photo, image. |
| 📘 student | For studies -> taking notes, organizing, studying. |
| 🎮 Gamer | Lots of native Linux games. |
| 🎒 teen | Fun and educational apps to get started with the internet. |
| 🧩 child | Educational software for learning, without internet access. |
| 🧸 baby | Very stripped-down system -> learning the mouse, numbers, shapes, etc. |

### The nodes

:::note[What is a node?]
A network is made up of computers called "nodes". Each has its own purpose.
This information is not necessary to use the cloud but helps understand how it works.
:::

#### NixOS nodes

They are 100% managed (automatically installed and updated):

| **Type** | **Purpose** |
|----|----|
| ❄️ [Top Linux PC](#linux-workstations-nixos) | Complete, configured, secure, shared workstation.<br/>→ I just need to connect and work, play, entertain myself. |
| 🗄️ Server | A computer that stays on to host services:<br/>→ Jellyfin, Immich, Nextcloud, backups, shares, etc. |
| 🌐 Gateway | A little gem that links the local network to the Internet.<br/>→ Firewall, router, DNS server, VPN client... |
| 🎼&nbsp;Coordination&nbsp;server | This dark individual is the "conductor" of the network.<br/>→ Somewhere on the internet, always ready to serve us. |

:::note[Learn more]
On the composition of the network in [its presentation](/doc/introduction/#the-dnf-network).
:::

#### Attached nodes

I can connect third-party devices to the network:

- 📱 **My smartphone, tablet**<br/>I can connect to the network and all its services.
- 💻 **My computer / beloved system**<br/>Under Windows, macOS or Linux, I can also access the services.

## Connecting and managing my account

I need:

* **A master password** for my vault (vaultwarden).
* **A unique identity** for all cloud services (kanidm / IDM).

My administrator must perform a procedure so I can define these accesses.

* **Master password**: an email containing a link to enter the password.
* **Identity**: a QR-Code or a link to define a key and a "2FA" password.

:::tip[Things to know!]
- 🔐 **My master password** (Vaultwarden / Bitwarden)<br/>allows me to connect to my vault.
- 🔑 **My authentication key** (IDM Key)<br/>allows me to connect to all cloud applications.
- 🔐 **My "two-factor" password** (2FA Key)<br/>allows me to connect as well, if I have a problem with my key.
:::

The **master password** is paramount, it's the only thing that is **absolutely necessary to remember**.

My identification follows this schema:

![Identification workflow](../../../../assets/identification.png)

:::note[What is a key?]
A digital key allows identification without having to use a password.
It is located in my vault.
When an application needs it, Bitwarden opens automatically.
This is the **SIMPLEST AND MOST SECURE** way to authenticate myself.
:::

:::note[A "two-factor" password?]
Two-factor authentication (2FA) uses:
- a password (something I know)
- AND another "factor" (something I own)

The latter can be a code sent by email / sms, a 6-digit code generator, etc.
These days, a huge number of passwords are compromised, which is why this type of authentication is becoming necessary.
:::

:::caution[Securing my vault]
To facilitate access to the vault (vaultwarden / bitwarden), a "simple" master password is allowed by default.
But it is highly recommended to add a second factor to secure access, especially if I put all my passwords in it (bank, social accounts, etc.).
:::

## Online services

All cloud services are open-source and have their own online documentation. But here are some useful short introductions.

### 🔐 Vaultwarden

Vaultwarden is my vault. It contains my passwords, digital keys, credit cards, and confidential information.
This information is stored encrypted and backed up automatically. By default, I am the only one who has access.

:::tip[Useful features]
- Share access with others thanks to "collections".
- Organize my passwords and keys into folders.
- Send confidential information thanks to "sends".
:::

:::note[Bitwarden: the client application]
Bitwarden can be installed as a **browser plugin** or as a **mobile application**.
It simplifies my life thanks to automatic entry of my credentials and passwords and many other features.
Bitwarden can do everything Vaultwarden can (the server, which holds the data).
:::

:::caution[Important: Bitwarden configuration]
By default, Bitwarden is set to "bitwarden.com".
You must select "self-hosted" and then enter the Vaultwarden URL to be able to use Bitwarden with the cloud.

⚠️ I MUST NOT ENTER MY MASTER PASSWORD BEFORE DOING THIS.
:::


### 👨 Kanidm (idm)

My identity manager, which allows me to easily identify myself to cloud services.

### 🖼️ Immich (photos)

My personal photo and video manager, with sovereign and effective AI face recognition and search functions.

To synchronize photos from my smartphone to Immich:

* Install the immich application on the smartphone.
* Set up synchronization by giving the Immich URL.

### ☁️ Nextcloud (files & data)

A space for my files, contacts, calendars, and many other personal data, that I can synchronize and share.

### 💬 Matrix (messages & video)

My social network. All my conversations are encrypted and stay at home. I can link it to the federation (other matrix networks) or not.
I can also synchronize my WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, Signal, Discord accounts...

* Install "Element" on PC and Element Classic on android / ios:
  * Access the network matrix.domain.tld (do not go to matrix.org!)
  * Connect with "IDM" (do not create an account!)
  * The matrix account is created on first access
  * Invite the user to the rooms
* For calls to work (like with whatsapp), notifications must be activated and authorized.

:::caution[Select the correct matrix server!]
Click on "Self-Hosted" then enter the cloud's matrix domain.
:::

### 🎬 Jellyfin (movies & music)

My personal media library for my movies and music, that I can use with my television.
