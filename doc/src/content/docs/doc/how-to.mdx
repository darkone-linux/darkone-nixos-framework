## Create a usb key

To create a crypted and portable NixOS system on a usb key:

<Steps>

1. Create a minimal NixOS system

```shell
cd /etc/nixos

# Nix-shell with required tools + root
sudo just create-key-shell

# Launch with the key name + peripheral
# -> IMPORTANT: all data in the peripheral will be lose
# -> This script will prompt the luks password
just create-key-on my-key /dev/sdb

# Quit the nix-shell
exit
```

2. Declare the new host

```yaml
# usr/config.yaml
hosts:
  static:
    - hostname: "my-key"
      name: "My portable system"
      profile: "portable"
      users: [ "darkone", "gponcon" ]
```

```shell
# Generate, fix, check...
just clean
```

3. Apply the configuration

Launch the usb key system with any machine (click F12 at startup, then choose the usb key). The minimal installation have a special `nix` user used for maintenance.

```shell
# Network check: "my-key" must be accessible
ping my-key

# Register and install the new host
just install my-key
```
