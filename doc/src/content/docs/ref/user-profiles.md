Each user have a **profile declaration** in the general nix configuration and a **home profile** used by home manager. For example:

- `lib/homes/admin.nix` contains the `users.users.` declaration.
- `lib/homes/admin/` contains home manager files for this profile.

Coming soon: list of standard user/home profiles and how to create profiles.
