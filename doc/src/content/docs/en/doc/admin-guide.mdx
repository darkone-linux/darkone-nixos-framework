## Getting started

The DNF network typically consists of a gateway and its clients.

:::caution
This section dedicated to the administrator of a DNF network is not yet up to date as the project is unstable. It will contain everything you need to set up and administer a network.
:::

### Manual installation

This procedure should be automated in the future.

:::tip
To familiarize yourself with this installation, it is advisable to test it using virtual machines.
:::

#### 1. Let's start by creating the gateway

:::note
This host will contains dnsmasq (dhcp + dns), the Nix source code for your entire network (gateway, workstations, servers) and [some services of your choice](/en/ref/modules/#-darkonehostgateway).
You won't need to edit the details of these configurations 🚀.

The gateway is a very important node of your local network. If you want to manage your network with DNF, create it first is a good idea.

<Steps>

1. Install a NixOS system from minimal ISO image

    Download [NixOS minimal ISO image](https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-25.05/latest-nixos-minimal-x86_64-linux.iso), boot on it and follow the instructions (change the values according to your needs):

    ```sh
    # Disk to use
    export DISK=/dev/nvme0n1

    # GPT
    parted $DISK -- mklabel gpt

    # Partitions: boot + system + data + swap
    sgdisk --clear \
        --new=1:0:+1GiB    --typecode=1:ef00 --change-name=1:EFI \
        --new=2:0:+200GiB  --typecode=2:8303 --change-name=2:SYS \
        --new=3:0:-8192MiB --typecode=3:8300 --change-name=3:DAT \
        --new=4:0:0        --typecode=4:8200 --change-name=4:SWP \
        $DISK

    # Checks
    fdisk -l | grep -e '^/dev'
    ls -l /dev/disk/by-partlabel
    parted $DISK -- print

    # Filesystems
    mkfs.fat -F 32 -n boot /dev/disk/by-partlabel/EFI
    mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/disk/by-partlabel/SYS
    mkfs.ext4 -L data /dev/disk/by-partlabel/DAT
    mkswap -L swap /dev/disk/by-partlabel/SWP

    # Mount all
    mount -o 'defaults,noatime,discard' /dev/disk/by-partlabel/SYS /mnt
    mount --mkdir -o 'defaults,noatime,discard,user_xattr' /dev/disk/by-partlabel/DAT /mnt/data
    mount --mkdir /dev/disk/by-partlabel/EFI /mnt/boot
    swapon /dev/disk/by-partlabel/SWP
    mount | grep $DISK

    # Generate the configuration
    nixos-generate-config --root /mnt

    # Replace configuration.nix by this one, after modifying it according to your needs.
    # To check: hostname, timezone, lang, nix password and/or ssh key
    echo '''{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:
    {
      # Options to update
      networking.hostName = "";
      time.timeZone = "Europe/Paris";
      i18n.defaultLocale = "fr_FR.UTF-8";
      console = {
        keyMap = lib.mkForce "fr";
        earlySetup = true;
      };
      users.users.nix = {
        uid = 65000;
        initialPassword = "nixos";
        isNormalUser = true;
        extraGroups = [ "wheel" ];
        openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [
          "ssh-ed25519 xxxx your@key.com"
        ];
      };

      imports =
        [
          ./hardware-configuration.nix
        ];
      boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true;
      boot.loader.efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;
      security.sudo.wheelNeedsPassword = false;
      environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ vim git just ];
      services.openssh.enable = true;
      system.stateVersion = "25.11";
    }
    ''' > /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix

    # Install nixos
    nixos-install --no-root-passwd

    # unmount and reboot
    umount -R /mnt
    reboot

    # After reboot, update the nix user password
    passwd
    ```

    :::note
    This configuration is temporary. It will be replaced by the DNF one.
    :::

    :::tip
    For more convenience during the following installation, access this minimal installation from another computer.
    :::

2. Create your repository

    Fork the [Darkone NixOS Framework](https://github.com/darkone-linux/darkone-nixos-framework),
    give your project the name of your local network.

    After that, clone it in `/usr/nixos` with the `nix` user and edit the main configuration:

    ```sh
    # With the nix user
    cd /etc
    sudo mv nixos nixos-dist
    sudo mkdir nixos && chown nix:users nixos
    git clone <your-repository> nixos && cd nixos
    git switch -c my-configuration # optional
    mkdir -p usr/machines/gw # use the hostname of your gateway!
    cp nixos-dist/hardware-configuration.nix usr/machines/gw/
    vim usr/config.yaml
    ```

    :::note
    This fork is not intended to create PRs for DNF, however it is possible
    to do so by separating the framework code and the network code (`usr` folder)
    into two different branches.
    :::

3. Edit a minimal [configuration](https://github.com/darkone-linux/darkone-nixos-framework/blob/main/usr/config.yaml)

    Fill the minimum information to generate your first system. Example:

    ```yaml
    # Local network configuration
    network:
      domain: "my.lan" # Your network domain
      timezone: "America/Miquelon"
      locale: "fr_FR.UTF-8"
      gateway:
        hostname: "gw" # Name of the gateway host
        wan:
          interface: "eth0" # internet-connected interface
          gateway: "192.168.0.1" # upstream gateway
        lan:
          interfaces: ["enu1u4"] # interfaces in the lan bridge
          ip: "192.168.1.1" # gateway IP address
          prefixLength: 24
          dhcp-range:
            - "192.168.1.100,192.168.1.230,24h"
        services: ["homepage", "ncps", "adguardhome"] # useful services

    # A real user (you?)
    users:
      alice:
        uid: 1000
        name: "Alice Doe"
        profile: "admin"
        groups: ["admin"]

    # Host collection (just our gateway for now)
    hosts:
      static:
        - hostname: "gw"
          name: "Local Gateway"
          profile: "gateway" # Install a host of type "gateway"
          groups: ["admin"] # Alice also belongs to this group
          aliases: ["gateway", "router"] # Name aliases
    ```

4. Perform your first generation

   ```sh
   # Enter in a nix-shell with required dependencies
   just develop

   # Configure keys, generator and sops (will prompt for main password)
   just install-admin-host

   # Do this for each user
   just passwd <user>

   # Generate, check and clean your configuration
   just clean

   # Add and commit
   git add . && git commit -m "My first configuration"

   # Build and apply your first configuration!
   just apply-local
   ```

5. Congratulation, you have a full-featured gateway!

   Let's test it inside (with "nix" user):

   ```sh
   # Got to /etc/nixos
   nx

   # Edit a file with your fantastic vim
   vim usr/config/yaml

   # Display the git tree
   git tree

   # Clean your host
   mrproper

   # Check your network
   ip a
   brctl show
   systemctl status dnsmasq
   ip n
   ```

   Your gateway is configured to assign IP addresses and share the Internet connection.
   On the browser of a host connected to its LAN, you can access the home page by typing
   `http://<your-gateway-name>` and the services by typing `http://<service-name>`.

</Steps>

## The "just" commands

In the root folder, type `just` ([example with `just clean`](/en/doc/specifications/#the-generator))

```shell
❯ just
Available recipes:
[apply]
apply on what='switch'         # Apply configuration using colmena
apply-force on what='switch'   # Apply with build-on-target + force repl. unk profiles
apply-local what='switch'      # Apply the local host configuration
apply-verbose on what='switch' # Apply force with verbose options

[check]
check                          # Recursive deadnix on nix files

[install]
copy-hw host                   # Extract hardware config from host
copy-id host                   # Copy pub key to the node (nix user must exists)

enter host                     # Interactive shell to the host
fix-boot on                    # Multi-reinstall bootloader (using colmena)
fix-zsh on                     # Remove zshrc bkp to avoid error when replacing zshrc
gc on                          # Multi garbage collector (using colmena)
halt on                        # Multi-alt (using colmena)
